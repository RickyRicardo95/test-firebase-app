    <h2>Prerendering (SSG)</h2>
    <p>Prerendering maintains the same performance benefits of server-side rendering (SSR) but achieves a reduced Time to First Byte (TTFB),
      ultimately enhancing user experience. The key distinction lies in an approach where pages are served as static content, and there is no request-based rendering.
